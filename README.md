# GitBasics-Trap
Group Task

In your teams, today's Scrum Master should make a Git repository entitled GitBasics-<team_name>.

 

This repo will encompass all aspects of Git that we've covered. This includes:
    - adding, committing, and pushing
    - forking and cloning
    - reverting and/or resetting commits
    - a feature-branch model with MAIN, DEV, and FEATURE/<xyz> branches
    - each team member must contribute at least two FEATURE/<xyz> branches
    - pull requests for merging your FEATURE/<xyz>s to your DEV
    - pull requests for merging your DEV to the SM's MAIN
    - pull request(s) for merging the SM's DEV to the SM's MAIN
    - setting your group members as collaborators
    - branch protection on the MAIN and DEV branches
    - 2 approvals before a PR is accepted, one must be from the Scrum Master

 

I'd recommend that the SM sets up the MAIN and DEV branches with a commit on each branch, then has everybody fork and clone it down.
